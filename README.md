# Tab List

A simple tab list functionality built with vanilla JavaScript.

Things I learned while building this:

- How to make your document accessible and SEO-friendly with aria-\* attributes,
- No need to use CSS classes unnecessarily when aria-\* attribute selectors do the deed, perfectly,
- Both querySelectorAll() and find() methods can find an element, however, find() is a little more elegant,
- And, finally, how to put everything together.
